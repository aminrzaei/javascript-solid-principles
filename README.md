# SOLID principles

> This repository contains the SOLID principles details and code examples written in various programming languages.

## Definition

SOLID is a mnemonic acronym for five design principles intended to make software designs more understandable, flexible, and maintainable.

The SOLID principles are:

### [S] Single responsibility principle

There should never be more than one reason for a class to change.
In other words, every class should have only one responsibility.

### [O] Openâ€“Closed principle

Software entities should be open for extension, but closed for modification.

### [L] Liskov substitution principle

Functions that use pointers or references to base classes must be able to use objects of derived classes without knowing it.
See also design by contract.

### [I] Interface segregation principle

Many client-specific interfaces are better than one general-purpose interface.

### [D] Dependency inversion principle

Depend upon abstractions, not concretions.
